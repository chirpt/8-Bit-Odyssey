Prologue
As the game opens, we see a dark and stormy sea, with lightning flashing across the sky and waves crashing against the sides of a small ship. On board, the crew is huddled together, looking nervous and afraid. Suddenly, a figure appears on the deck: it is Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, in all her divine glory. She speaks to the captain, Odysseus, telling him that he has angered the gods with his pride and arrogance, and that he and his crew will face many trials and tribulations before they can return home. But she also offers him her protection and guidance, telling him that if he remains steadfast and resourceful, he may yet survive his ordeal and find his way back to Ithaca. With that, she disappears into the storm, leaving Odysseus and his crew to face their fate.
