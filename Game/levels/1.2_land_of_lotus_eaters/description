Act 1
Scene 2 
Land of the Lotus Eaters INTERLUDE? + CHALLENGE
Outline
Collect all the crew members and escape the island before they eat the lotus flowers and forget about their desire to return home.
Odysseus and his crew land on an island inhabited by the Lotus Eaters. They are given lotus flowers to eat, which cause them to forget their homesickness and desire to return home.
The level begins with Odysseus and his crew landing on the island and exploring the fields.
The crew members soon come across the lotus flowers and start eating them, causing them to fall under the spell of the lotus and forget their mission to return home.
Challenges
Obstacles: The crew members will wander off and sit idly, eating the lotus flowers. Odysseus must find them and convince them to leave the island.
Odysseus must navigate the fields and find the affected crew members, who are wandering aimlessly and unaware of their surroundings.
Once he finds a crew member, Odysseus must engage in a mini-game to snap them out of their trance and bring them back to reality. The mini-game could involve a puzzle or a timed button sequence.
After rescuing all of the crew members, Odysseus must find a way to leave the island before any more of his men succumb to the lotus's effects.
To complete the level, Odysseus must navigate through the island, finding each of his crew members and convincing them to leave. The crew members are scattered throughout the island, and Odysseus must explore various areas to locate them. Once he finds a crew member, he must engage in a conversation with them and convince them to leave the island. The crew members may initially resist, as the effects of the lotus flower are strong, but with persistence and persuasion, they will agree to leave. Once all crew members are collected, Odysseus must lead them to the ship and set sail for the next destination.

Outcome
The level ends with the crew safely back on their ship, sailing away from the island and leaving the lotus eaters behind.
