The inside of Polyphemus' cave is dark and damp, with stalactites hanging from the ceiling and boulders strewn about. The walls are rough and uneven, and there are scattered bones and animal skins on the ground. Polyphemus' bed is made of straw and animal skins, and there is a large fire pit in the center of the cave. The boss battle takes place in the area where Polyphemus stores his sheep and cheeses. The air is thick with the smell of sheep and cheese, and the ground is slick with their fluids.
