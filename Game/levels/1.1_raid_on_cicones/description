DESIGN
Dark blue (#0B3D91) for the sea surrounding the island
Sandy brown (#F4A460) for the beach where the raiding party lands
Dark grey (#2F4F4F) for the walls and towers of the town
Light grey (#D3D3D3) for the buildings and streets inside the town

Background shows the island in the center of the screen, with the sea surrounding it. The town is shown in the center of the island, with the walls and towers visible. The streets and alleyways between the buildings, with some buildings taller than others to give a sense of depth. Raiding party lands on the beach, with pixelated figures representing the soldiers and their ships. Design should be simple and easy to navigate, while still conveying the feel of a fortified town.
