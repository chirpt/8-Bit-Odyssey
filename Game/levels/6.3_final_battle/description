Act 6
Scene 18
The Final Battle

Outline
After successfully reclaiming his throne and disposing of the suitors, Odysseus must face one final challenge. The families of the suitors, seeking revenge for their deaths, have gathered their forces and launched an attack on Odysseus's palace. In this epic battle, Odysseus must defend his home and family against the vengeful army. Athena once again returns, giving a choice to either make his armour or weapons more powerful, sometimes casting shields during battle.

Challenges
The battle will be divided into several stages, each with its own set of challenges. At the beginning, Odysseus must hold the palace gates against waves of attackers. Then, he must lead a counterattack to push the enemy back and gain ground. Along the way, there will be various obstacles to overcome, such as barricades and traps set by the enemy.

Boss
The final boss will be the leader of the enemy army, a powerful warrior seeking to avenge the deaths of the suitors. This boss will have a range of attacks and strategies to make the fight challenging and dynamic.

Outcome
If Odysseus can defeat the enemy leader, the remaining forces will retreat and the battle will be won. The game will end with a cutscene showing Odysseus reunited with his family and his kingdom at peace once again. However, if Odysseus is defeated, the game will end with a different cutscene, showing his family and kingdom in ruin and his legacy tarnished.

Setting
The battle will take place in and around Odysseus's palace, with various areas serving as different stages of the fight. There will be narrow corridors and staircases inside the palace, allowing for intense close-quarters combat, as well as open courtyards and gardens for larger-scale battles. The setting will be designed to reflect the grandeur and majesty of ancient Greek architecture, with ornate pillars, statues, and frescoes lining the walls.
