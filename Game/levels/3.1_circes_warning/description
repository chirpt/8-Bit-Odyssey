The level takes place in a magical forest on the island of Aeaea, where the trees and plants seem to come alive and move on their own. The forest is shrouded in a misty haze and filled with strange and otherworldly creatures. As the player progresses through the level, they encounter various magical landmarks, such as a shimmering pool of water and a glowing crystal cave.
