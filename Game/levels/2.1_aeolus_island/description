Act 2
Scene 4 
Aeolus' Island INTERLUDE + CHALLENGE
Outline
Odysseus and his crew reach the island of Aeolus, the god of winds. Aeolus gives Odysseus a bag containing all the winds except for the favorable west wind, which will guide them safely back to Ithaca. However, the crew becomes suspicious of the bag's contents while Odysseus sleeps and opens it, releasing all the unfavorable winds and blowing them far off course.

Platforming through windy terrain: Odysseus and his crew must navigate through strong winds and gusts that push them around and threaten to knock them off platforms.
Puzzles involving wind manipulation: Odysseus must use the power of the winds to solve puzzles, such as redirecting gusts to activate switches or creating wind currents to reach high platforms.
Avoiding obstacles: The winds also create hazards, such as flying debris and obstacles that are blown around by the gusts.
OR
Navigating through the storm created by the unleashed winds
Dodging debris and obstacles carried by the storm
Fighting off sea monsters drawn to the chaos of the storm
Boss
None
Outcome
After navigating through the winds and solving puzzles, Odysseus and his crew are forced to leave Aeolus' island without the favorable west wind. They must continue their journey using only the strength of their oars and the winds that they encounter along the way. The ships are thrown off course
Setting
The Isle of Aeolus is depicted as a windy, rugged terrain with steep cliffs and rocky outcroppings. The landscape is constantly buffeted by gusts of wind, which make movement challenging and create an atmosphere of danger and uncertainty. Aeolus' palace, which is perched on the highest point of the island, is decorated with symbols of the winds, such as wind vanes and flags.
OR
The level takes place in the middle of a raging storm, with powerful winds blowing in every direction and waves crashing against the ship. The sky is dark and ominous, with lightning flashes illuminating the chaos. The Aeolian island can be seen in the distance, shrouded in mist and mystery. The ship is constantly rocked by the storm, with the crew struggling to maintain their footing and the sails.
